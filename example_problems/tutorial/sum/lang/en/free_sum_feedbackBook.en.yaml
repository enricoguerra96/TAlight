#NOW THE PROBLEM SERVICE SPECIFIC SECTION:
too-much: 'indeed, {a}+{b}={a+b} > {s}.'
too-little: 'indeed, {a}+{b}={a+b} < {s}.'
right-sum: 'indeed, {a}+{b}={s}.'
not-balanced: 'indeed, even {a-1}+{b+1}={s} and {a-1}*{b+1}={(a-1)*(b+1)} > {a*b}={a}*{b}.'
max-product: 'indeed, x={a} and y={b} have maximum product among the integer numbers with x+y={s}. Do you know why? Do you have a proof for your intuition?'
