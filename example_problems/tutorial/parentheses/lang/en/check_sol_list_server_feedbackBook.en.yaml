open-channel: '# I will serve: problem={problem}, service={service}\n#  with arguments: '
feedback_source: '# The phrases used in this call of service {service} come from the file \''{service}_feedbackBook.{ENV["lang"]}.yaml\'' placed in the \''lang\'' folder of problem {problem}.'

#NOW THE PROBLEM SERVICE SPECIFIC SECTION:
at-least-one-line: 'No. You are required to enter at least one well-formed formula of parentheses (possibly even just the empty one) before closing.'
first-line-not-well-formed: 'No. Your very first formula of parentheses is not well formed.'
wrong-first: 'No. Your very first formula of parentheses is well-formed but but it is not the first well-formed-formula on that number of parentheses according to the order that has been set.'
called-with: '(service called with'
different_lengths: 'No. The well-formed formula of parentheses you have just introduced in your line {len(input_solution_list)+1} has different length than the previous ones.'
order-violation: 'No. The well-formed formula of parentheses you have just introduced in your line {len(input_solution_list)+1} does not come after but rather before than the previous one according to the order set.'
repeated: 'No. The well-formed formula of parentheses you have just introduced in your line {len(input_solution_list)+1} is the same as your {input_solution_list.index(line)+1}th one. But nothing is lost: this repetition will be ignored. You can go on.'
your-formulas-all-ok: 'All the formulas you have introduced are ok (well formed) and correctly ordered.'
one-formula-is-missing-no-feedback: 'No. Your list is missing at least one well-formed formula.'
give-missing-formula: 'Consider for example:'
not-consecutive: 'In fact, the two well-formed formulas:\n {input_solution_list[pos-1]}\n {input_solution_list[pos]}\nthat appear consecutive in your list are NOT consecutive in the intended order'
first-missing-prefix: 'As a strong hint, here is the prefix of a well-formed formula and no formula in your list has this prefix:'
list-ok: 'Ok! You have listed all well-formed formulas with {n_pairs} pairs of parentheses. Also their order is the intended one.'
not-well-formed-formula: 'We have a problem. The following formula in not well formed:'
unfeasible: 'Indeed on position {i} there is no open parenthesis left to be closed:'
pointer: '^ unmatched ")"'
unfinished: 'Indeed {num_dangling_open} open parenthesis are left unclosed. The formula contains more \''(\'' than \'')\'' characters.'
