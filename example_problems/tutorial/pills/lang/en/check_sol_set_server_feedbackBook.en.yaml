#NOW THE PROBLEM SERVICE SPECIFIC SECTION:
at-least-one-line: 'No. You are required to enter at least one feasible treatment (possibly even just the empty one) before closing.'
first-line-not-feasible: 'No. Your very first treatment is not feasible.'
different_lengths: 'No. The treatment you have just introduced in your line {len(input_solution_list)+1} has different length than the previous ones.'
repeated: 'No. The treatment you have just introduced in your line {len(input_solution_list)+1} is the same as your {input_solution_list.index(line)+1}th one. But nothing is lost: this repetition will be ignored. You can go on.'
your-treatments-all-ok: 'All the treatments you have introduced are feasible.'
one-treatment-is-missing-no-feedback: 'No. Your set is missing at least one feasible treatment.'
give-missing-treatment: 'Consider for example:'
one-missing-minimal-prefix: 'As a strong hint, here is the prefix of a feasible treatment and no treatment in your set has this prefix:'
not-well-formed-treatment: 'We have a problem. The following treatment is out of order:'
unfeasible: 'Indeed, when you get to the \''H\'' in position {i} there is no broken pill left to be eaten. This prescription is not consistent.'
pointer: '^ no half pill is available at this point in the flask'
unfinished: 'Indeed there are {num_dangling_broken_pills} broken pills left over in the flask. This prescription is not consistent. It contains more \''I\'' than \''H\'' characters.'
