# This folder contains a Gallery of possible approaches to this modeling problem
### (from the simplest to the most advanced, and explained)

This gallery is intended for possible (and partial) visualization to the advancing student.
The accessibility to the solutions may be regulated through a token system.
The tokens are either granted by the instructor (following a certain timing, and/or upon receiving requests)
or based on the advancing of the student.
Indeed, the token to access a solution can be immidiately granted asap the problem-solver (i.e., the student)
has submitted a code achieving a superset of the goals achieved by that solution.
(And the student is encouraged to share her solution with the problem-poser (i.e., the instructor)
when she believes having achieved those goals by other means).
